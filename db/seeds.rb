Article.create(title: 'Fear not, China is not banning cryptocurrency', body: "In 2008 following the financial crisis, a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was published, detailing the concepts of a payment system. Bitcoin was born. Bitcoin gained the attention of the world for its use of blockchain technology and as an alternative to fiat currencies and commodities. Dubbed the next best technology after the internet, blockchain offered solutions to issues we have failed to address, or ignored over the past few decades. I will not delve into the technical aspect of it but here are some articles and videos that I recommend:

How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood

A gentle introduction to blockchain technology

Ever wonder how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work?

Fast forward to today, 5th February to be exact, authorities in China have just unveiled a new set of regulations to ban cryptocurrency. The Chinese government have already done so last year, but many have circumvented through foreign exchanges. It has now enlisted the almighty ‘Great Firewall of China’ to block access to foreign exchanges in a bid to stop its citizens from carrying out any cryptocurrency transactions.

To know more about the Chinese government stance, let’s backtrack a couple years back to 2013 when Bitcoin was gaining popularity among the Chinese citizens and prices were soaring. Concerned with the price volatility and speculations, the People’s Bank of China and five other government ministries published an official notice on December 2013 titled “Notice on Preventing Financial Risk of Bitcoin” (Link is in Mandarin). Several points were highlighted:

1. Due to various factors such as limited supply, anonymity and lack of a centralized issuer, Bitcoin is not a official currency but a virtual commodity that cannot be used in the open market.

2. All banks and financial organizations are not allowed to offer Bitcoin-related financial services or engage in trading activity related to Bitcoin.

3. All companies and websites that offer Bitcoin-related services are to register with the necessary government ministries.

4. Due to the anonymity and cross-border features of Bitcoin, organizations providing Bitcoin-related services ought to implement preventive measures such as KYC to prevent money laundering. Any suspicious activity including fraud, gambling and money laundering should to be reported to the authorities.

5.Organizations providing Bitcoin-related services ought to educate the public about Bitcoin and the technology behind it and not mislead the public with misinformation.

In layman’s term, Bitcoin is categorized as a virtual commodity (e.g in-game credits,) that can be bought or sold in its original form and not to be exchanged with fiat currency. It cannot be defined as money- something that serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of accounting, and a store of value.

Despite the notice being dated in 2013, it is still relevant with regards to the Chinese government stance on Bitcoin and as mentioned, there is no indication of the banning Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Rather, regulation and education about Bitcoin and blockchain will play a role in the Chinese crypto-market.

A similar notice was issued on Jan 2017, again emphasizing that Bitcoin is a virtual commodity and not a currency. In September 2017, the boom of initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to the publishing of a separate notice titled “Notice on Preventing Financial Risk of Issued Tokens”. Soon after, ICOs were banned and Chinese exchanges were investigated and eventually closed. (Hindsight is 20/20, they have made the right decision to ban ICOs and stop senseless gambling). Another blow was dealt to China’s cryptocurrency community in January 2018 when mining operations faced serious crackdowns, citing excessive electricity consumption." , cover_img_url: "https://blog.giantswarm.io/assets/2015/04/Wikimedia_Servers-small.jpg")

Article.create(title: "Are high US healthcare costs just an illusion?" , body: "Readers of American Nations often ask if something changed with regard to the regional cultures to allow the 2016 Republican nominee, Donald Trump, to capture the Electoral College votes of several key “blue” and swing states and, thus, the White House.

The answer, which initially surprises many, is no. Voting behaviors among the 11 “nations” I identify in the book actually corresponded to what one would have expected. The critical difference wasn’t that some regional cultures had suddenly become “more conservative” or “less liberal,” whatever those terms are supposed to mean these days. What changed was the political program offered by the Republican nominee, who promised the most communitarian-minded agenda of any such nominee in the past four decades. His complete reversal of those promises will likely allow Democrats to roll back his gains in the very places that proved decisive last time around.

Here’s what happened in 2016, as seen through the lens of America’s regional cultures, which, as I’ve previously demonstrated in this series, have more influence on electoral outcomes than the differences between rural and urban life or between the states, whose borders were often drawn with little thought to actual settlement history and cultural fissures. (If you’re new to this paradigm, you can find a summary here.)

First, the top-line results: Just as one would expect, the more communitarian-minded candidate—Hillary Clinton, in this election—won Left Coast, New Netherland, and Yankeedom by wide margins. Like her Democratic predecessor, Clinton also had a wide margin of victory in Tidewater and El Norte, two onetime swing regions that have, for differing reasons, become reliable members of the “blue” coalition over the past 15 years. She also captured the southernmost part of Florida, which is part of a wider Spanish Caribbean regional culture that (like Hawaii and Newfoundland) is not treated in American Nations. In almost all of these “nations,” Clinton actually matched or outperformed Barack Obama’s 2012 results.", cover_img_url: "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*52Uhc6GsR45RoYK5QJM1Qg.png")
